# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming reference

## Motivation

In competitive programming, we don't care too much about readability so sometimes we don't even know what our code does.
This repository is used for saving my code that has been accepted in online judge and I make it a bit cleaner so I can read it anytimes
just in case I forgot some algorithm. These code are usefull too if I need some algorithm for making a cheat sheet in some contests.

## Contributors
These code follow my style and thus I don't think anyone can contribute in this repository. But any suggestions would be very welcome!
