# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming reference

## Motivation

In competitive programming, we do not care too much about readability so sometimes we do not even know what our code does.
This repository is used for saving my code that has been accepted in online judge and I make it a bit cleaner so I can read it anytime
just in case I forgot some algorithms. These codes are usefull too if I need some algorithms for making a cheat sheet in a contest.

## Contributors
These codes follow my style and thus I do not think anyone can contribute in this repository. But any suggestions would be very welcome!
