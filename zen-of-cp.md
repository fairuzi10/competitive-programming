# The Zen of Competitive Programming

'If' is better than long analysis.

Index is better than pointer/iterator.

If you have to use pointer/iterator, use 'while' than 'for' and save prev or next in variable.

Gradient should never be used.

Write down the formula first if your teammate is still using the computer.
